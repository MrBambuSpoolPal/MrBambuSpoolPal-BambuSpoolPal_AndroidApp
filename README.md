# MrBambuSpoolPal-BambuSpoolPal_AndroidApp
An Android App to Scan Bambu Lab RFID tags and update them into Spoolman for effortless stock management.


The purpose of this application is to automate the tracking of [official Bambu Lab spools](https://us.store.bambulab.com/collections/bambu-lab-3d-printer-filament?skr=yes) with [Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman/wiki).

Scan your spools with your NFC-enabled phone to extract an identifier, density, initial weight, and length.

Using the [Spoolman filament database](https://github.com/Donkie/SpoolmanDB) allows for a relevant selection of names for the filaments for referencing.

The current weight can be adjusted through buttons, the input field, the slider, or by AI recognition of values from a scale.

Once configured, access to the Spoolman APIs allows for automatic management of the filament and spool.
Through configuration, this communication can be automated with each weight modification.
